Synopsis:
  This proposal is for creating a botting program that runs onto of a game and mimics human mouse movements to avoid anti-cheat systems.
  MMOBot would give users a way to automate tasks within an game and complete ingame anti-botting features. The proposed game this bot
  would be built for is for the mmo "Old School Runescape"

General Ideas:
  - Capture natural mouse movemements and create a model for the botting program to follow
  - Successfully automate tasks within the game
  - Complete Random Event/AntiBotting events
  - Anti-player feature to prevent player reports
  - Error correction in case of bot leaving training area
  - Bot scheduling for auto login and auto log off
