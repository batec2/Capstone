Synopsis:
  This proposal seeks to create a website where users can publicly post their arduino projects, and step by step guides on how to replicate the projects.
  As well the proposed project aims to create a GUI where users can program their arduinos and set the behaviours of various elements attached to the arduino.
  If time permitting, we will also create an app that allows the user to control their creation through bluetooth on their phone.  

General Ideas:
  - Website
  - Arduino programming GUI
