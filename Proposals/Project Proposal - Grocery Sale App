Project Proposal – Grocery Sale App

This app allows a user to search sales at nearby grocery stores for the lowest prices. Items that are searched will display the current sale prices at the nearby stores, 
and highlight the lowest available price. Users can create a shopping list of items, and the list will automatically find the stores with the lowest prices. Users can
also select a nearby store and view the items at that store that are the lowest price in a search area. Users can select a sequence of stores, and their grocery list will
update with the lowest prices within the selected sequence.

The sale prices for items will be gathered from store websites and online flyers. The prices will need to be stored in a DataBase. There will have to be some kind of 
automated update, either daily or weekly, where new sale prices are added. The normal non-sale price of an item should be dsiplayed, and the record lowest price of an
item should also be displayed. If a sale has a set time period, the start and end dates of the sale should be displayed.

Extra goals: generate a graph for each item, displaying the historical prices over a period of time. Could be filtered for just a single store, or for a range of stores.
