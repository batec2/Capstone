Synopsis:
  This proposal is for creating a botting program that runs onto of a game and mimics human mouse movements to avoid anti-cheat systems.
  MMOBot would give users a way to automate tasks within an game and complete ingame anti-botting features. The proposed game this bot
  would be built for is for the mmo "Old School Runescape"

General Ideas:
  - Capture natural mouse movemements and create a model for the botting program to follow
  - Successfully automate tasks within the game
  - Complete Random Event/AntiBotting events
  - Anti-player feature to prevent player reports
  - Error correction in case of bot leaving training area
  - Bot scheduling for auto login and auto log off

Possible Technologies:
  Front-End:

  Back-End:
Bot Abilities:
  - Following Agility Course
  - Dismissing ingame Random Events/Ignoring
  - Picking up items

Natural Mouse Movements:
  - Record mouse movements of agility training lap 
  - Mouse movements segemented into parts
  - Create Decision Tree to generate natural mouse movements based on recorded data
  - Program decides on mouse movements by deciding which data point in a segement is more "natural"(closest, and similar mouse speed"
  - Once all segements are decided a full potential mouse path is created

Random Events:
  - Added random events to bot to simulate real person playing
  - AFK times
  - Disruptions (person walks in)
  - Tabbing out
  - Loss of concentration
  - Intentional ineffiecency

Automatic Scheduling(Imitating a real persons daily life):
  - Login/Logout
  - Sleep cycle
  - Work/School
  - Meal Times
  - Break Periods

Failure Correction:
  - Leaving training area
  - Avoiding bot behaviours(walking in to walls/Clicking on invalid Areas)
  - Fail safes for when situation unrecoverable(Logging out/Teleporting Out)
